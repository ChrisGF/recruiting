%p.interest-rate-explanation
  The average interest rate is <b>#{in_percent(@interest_rate_average)}%</b>. If you want the best interest rate, 95% of interest rates are less than <b>#{in_percent(@interest_5th_percentile)}%</b>. If you want to fund your  project as soon as possible, we recommend offering a higher rate than 95% of developers, which would be at least <b>#{in_percent(@interest_95th_percentile)}%</b>.
