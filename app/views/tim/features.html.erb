        By using the methods created while updating the criteria for deals, the above flash can be generated.  This allows the system to record the interest from the developer while showing them why their deal isn't currently being accepted.

      	 The above model UserDeal was created in order to serve as the association between users and deals.  This allows a user to follow an arbitrary number of deals and for deals to have an arbitrary number of followers.  The 'source:' parameter has been used to give the association convenient names.  I prefer creating a separate model over user has_and_belongs_to_many because it allows you more flexibility.  In this case, I have added a validation that prevents a user from following their own deals.
